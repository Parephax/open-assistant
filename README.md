## Open Assistant - Arch Linux Version
Open Source Voice Assistant - Make Your Own Minds

## Description
Open Assistant is an open source voice assistant able to complete operating system tasks using spoken commands.

Written in Python, Open Assistant also uses a number of bash shell scripts, and is able to function offline. 

Internet access is only needed to update the language model when the commands file is changed or for downloading information, such as news or weather. 

Vocal recordings never leave the machine.

## Installation
Download and unzip the Open Assistant source code archive into a directory of your choice.

Make files `oa.sh` and `oa.py` executable with the command:

    chmod +x oa.*

Install required packages:

    sudo pacman -S aplay flite gobject-introspection gstreamer lib32-gst-plugins-base xclip xdotool yay


    pip3 python-requests python-gobject


    yay pocketsphinx sphinxbase

## Usage
From within the OA directory, type:

    ./oa.sh

If you see `Stella: Listening`, Open Assistant is properly installed and running. Congratulations. :)

Say `Hello Stella` and listen for a response.

If there is no response, be sure to check your microphone and speaker levels. `mic-test.sh` has been included for convenient recording tests.

Voice commands and actions can be found in: `minds/stella/config/commands.json`

User specific configuration is located in: `oa.sh`

## Contributing
Hack away, friends! :)

Open Assistant is a unique and valuable project which could benefit anyone disabled, young, or elderly.

Let's make computing more fun, convenient, private, and accessible!

## Roadmap
Currently working to include a local language model toolkit, so OA will not require internet access to update commands. 

A comprehensive mapping of voice commands to all available keyboard shortcuts needs to be completed. 

Speech dictation is under development, with a new demo coming soon!

One small step at a time...
